# Expressions

# Introduction
An expression in C# is a combination of operands (variables, literals, method calls) and operators that can be evaluated to a single value. To be precise, an expression must have at least one operand but may not have any operator.

Example:
```cs
double age = 24;
```
In the example, **24** is an expression.
