A variable is a symbolic name given to a memory location. 
Variables are used to store data in a computer program.
You can imagine the variable as a box with a content. Like in the real world, the box can be empty or store a value. 
There are different types of variables, as we are going to learn in the next section.

# Declaring Variables
In C# we declare variables, using the following format:
```
{data type} {variable name} = {value};
```
- The data type can be any primitive data type or, as we are going to learn in future lectures and courses, we can define our own custom data types.
- the variable name should make sense 

Variables in C# must be declared before they can be used. This means, the name and type of variable must be known before they can be assigned a value.
