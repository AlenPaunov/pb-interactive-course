# Variables

[slide]
# Definition
A variable is a symbolic name given to a memory location. 
Variables are used to store data in a computer program.
You can imagine the variable as a box with a content. Like in the real world, the box can be empty or store a value. 
There are different types of variables, as we are going to learn in the next section.

# Declaring Variables
In C# we declare variables, using the following format:
```
{data type} {variable name} = {value};
```
- The data type can be any primitive data type or, as we are going to learn in future lectures and courses, we can define our own custom data types.
- the variable name should make sense 

Variables in C# must be declared before they can be used. This means, the name and type of variable must be known before they can be assigned a value.

# Best Practices

* Choose a variable name that make sense. For example, name, age, subject makes more sense than n, a and s.
* Use camelCase notation (starts with lowercase letter) for naming local variables. For example, numberOfStudents, age, etc.

You can learn more about naming conventions in C# [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/naming-guidelines).
