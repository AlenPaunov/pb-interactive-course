# Introduction
A statement is a basic unit of execution of a program. A program consists of multiple statements.
Example:
```
string name = "Peter";
int age = 25;
```

There are different types of statements. We are going to learn about two of them:

# Declaration Statements
Declaration statements are used to declare and initialize variables.

double grade = 6.00;
```
