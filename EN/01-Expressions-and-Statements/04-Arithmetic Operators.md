# Addition (Operator +)

We can add two numbers together using the + operator:
```csharp
int a = 5;
int b = 4;
int result = a + b;
// The result is 9.
```

# Substraction (Operator -)

We can substract one numbers from another using the - operator:
```csharp
int a = 5;
int b = 4;
int result = a - b;
// The result is 1.
```

# Multiplication (Operator *)

We can multiply two numbers using the * operator:
```csharp
int a = 5;
int b = 4;
int result = a * b;
// The result is 20.
```

# Division (Operator /)

We can divide two numbers using the / operator:
```csharp
int a = 5;
int b = 4;
int result = a / b;
// The result is 1.
```
Why is the result 1 and not 1.25?
* When we divide two integers, the result is also integer, so it doesn`t store the fractional part from the devision. Example: 14 / 3 = 4. 
Note, that the result is not rounded, just the fractional part is lost.
