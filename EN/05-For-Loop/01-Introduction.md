# For Loop in Real-World
Loops are programming constructs, which repeatedly perform an operation or series of operations over and over. With a while loop, you don't know how many times a loop is going to be executed. It's constantly checking and checking for a condition to determine whether or not it should execute one more time. Today we will learn another loop - the for loop. With a for loop, you know exactly how many times that loop is going to perform its operation before it even runs.

For example, I'll start loading the dirty dishes from the sink into the dishwasher. I know exactly how many dishes I'm going to move from the sink to the dishwasher before I start this task, because there is a certain number of dirty dishes in my sink. I won't stop loading the dishwasher until I've completed that task for all dirty dishes. So, I'll pick up the first one and put it in the dishwasher. That's one item. Then I'll pick up the second one and put it in the dishwasher and continue repeating same action until I put all dirty dishes in the dishwasher
